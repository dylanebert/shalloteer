**PlayerStartupSystem**
- Group: `'setup'`
- Purpose: Creates a fully-functional player entity if none exists
- Creates: One entity with complete player setup
- Components added:
  - Player (movement stats, jump control)
  - CharacterMovement (velocity management)
  - Transform (position/rotation/scale)
  - Body (kinematic physics body)
  - Collider (capsule shape)
  - CharacterController (ground detection, auto-step)
  - InputState (input mapping)
  - Respawn (respawn position)
- Condition: Only runs if no Player entities exist
- Defaults: Position (0, 5, 0), capsule collider, kinematic body

**PlayerCharacterSystem**
